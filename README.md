CustusX
========
### A Research Platform for Image-Guided Therapy



The system aids surgeons during interventions, enabling the surgeon to navigate 3D image data using tracked instruments. Focus is on use of ultrasound in surgery.

## Usage

DISCLAIMER: CustusX is a research tool: It is not intended for normal clinical use, and is not not FDA nor CE approved.

The code is free to download and use under a BSD-3 license. However, the code base is currently undergoing large changes, thus there is no guarantee that internal interfaces will be stable.

### Build instructions

CustusX uses a Python-based superbuild. Select a root folder, then all libs will be downloaded and built in separate folders beneath it, as follows:

|        |          |                |
| ------ | ----     | -------------- |
| root   | CustusX  | CustusX        |
|        |          | build_Release  |
|        | VTK      | VTK            |
|        |          | build_Release  |
|        | CTK      | CTK            |
|        |          | build_Release  |
|        | some_lib | some_lib       |
|        |          | build_Release  |

Run the following lines to get it right:
```bash
cd <root_dir>
git clone git@github.com:SINTEFMedisinskTeknologi/CustusX3.git CustusX/CustusX
./CustusX/CustusX/install/cxInstaller.py --root_dir . --full --all
```
The default root_dir is ~/dev/cx. Run cxInstaller.py -h for more options.

## Structure

CustusX is written in C++ using CMake, Qt, CTK, VTK, ITK, Eigen, OpenCV, IGSTK, OpenIGTLink and other libraries. The OSGi plugin framework implemented by CTK is used, and is the recommended way to extend CustusX yourself. The platform contains the CustusX application, but it is straightforward to build your own applications using the same platform.

## Contributors

CustusX is maintained by SINTEF Medical Technology, in cooperation with the Norwegian National Competence Services for Ultrasound and Image-Guided Therapy (St. Olavs Hospital, SINTEF, NTNU). The platform is used daily in research at St. Olavs Hospital and partners.
