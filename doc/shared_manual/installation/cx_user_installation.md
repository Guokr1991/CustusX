Installation {#installation}
===================

The easiest way to install is to use the installers from the [website](http://custusx.org/index.php/downloads). Check out the \ref supported_platforms.

Tracking System
-----------------------------------------------------------
In order to use a tracking system, the drivers must be correctly installed. For NDI, checkout \subpage install_ndi_driver.

You also need a valid definition of each physical tool (TBD).

Video Source
-----------------------------------------------------------
In order to use a video source, these drivers also must be correctly installed. Follow instructions for your
provider and platform. 

A quick check is to view the video using a standard webcam-application of some kind, f.ex. Photo Booth 
on Mac or Cheese on Linux. If this works, the video source should be ready to use in CustusX.
