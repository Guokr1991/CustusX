//! Operation: Interpolate transformation matrices.
// Suppose that T(t) is a time-variant 4-by-4 transformation matrix
// whos values at certain points, given in the vector DataPoints, are
// given in the vector DataValues. This operation, then, interpolates
// to find the values of T at the intermediate points given in the
// vector InterpolationPoints.
//
// The interpolated values are found in two different ways depending
// on the value of the InterpolationMethod string:
//   1. InterpolationMethod == "closest point": In this case, the
//      value at a given point is set to the value at the nearest
//      neighboring point with a known value.
//   2. InterpolationMethod == "linear": In this case, the rotation
//      part of the transformation matrix is found using the slerp
//      (spherical linear interpolation), while the translation part
//      is found using ordinary linear interpolation.
